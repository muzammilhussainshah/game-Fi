                <h2>NFT Games at Theme Parks: Ocean Park Hong Kong Announces New Digital Visitor
                    Experiences for 2022 Anniversary Year</h2>
                <p>01 Mar 2022</p>

                <p>For the upcoming season, when Ocean Park Hong Kong celebrates its 45th anniversary,
                    the marine and theme park located on the south side of Hong Kong Island has planned not only
                    its restructuring with a new arrangement of its different offerings and areas (cf. EAP 6/2021),
                    but also the introduction of new visitor experiences in the form of innovative digital offers.
                    These will be created in collaboration with The Sandbox (a subsidiary of gaming company Animoca Brands),
                    a so-called NFT game based on blockchain technology, where players can earn money while playing a video game (play-to-earn model).</p>

                <p>Ivan Wong, Chief Executive of Ocean Park since September 2021, sees this new partnership
                    as a strategic move in the park’s development, as he explains, “Our partnership with The Sandbox
                    is one of the new initiatives that the Park has embarked on and a strategic move for the brand.
                    It empowers the Park to develop immersive experiences, events and products in formats never before seen,
                    and venture into new business areas made possible by technology. We will fill our virtual land at The Sandbox
                    with creative content and offerings that are distinctively Ocean Park. We are confident that our fans and the
                    NFT community will welcome the opportunity to explore Ocean Park in a whole new dimension while
                    creating and sharing their user-generated content on our platform.”
                </p>
                <p>Sebastien Borget, COO & Co-Founder of The Sandbox, said, “We are thrilled to welcome Ocean Park
                    to The Sandbox metaverse. As one of Asia's most dynamic leisure and resort destinations, Ocean
                    Park also plays an iconic role in Hong Kong's cultural and entertainment landscape. We will work
                    with them on setting the first example of how entertainment can be leveraged with NFTs and play-and-earn
                    to engage and reward both local visitors and those from around the globe.” Further details about the
                    collaboration will be announced in due course. (eap)</p>
